                        1.1  Description
----------------------------------------------------------------


The caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools that 
can be used by an intermediate Java developer to create a 
'caCORE-like' system. Such systems are constructed using certain 
design principles:

     * UML Modeling
     * n-tier architecture with open APIs
     * controlled vocabularies
     * registered metadata

A system built along these lines is said to be 'semantically 
integrated', that is, there exists runtime metadata that describes 
every class and class attribute in the API.

                           1.2  History
----------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.1 (March 27, 2006)

    *  Added native CSM capability 
        o  CSM-SDK Adapter is no longer required
        o  Build script and properties files modified accordingly
    *  Updated architecture
        o  Changed application service layer (for compatibility with CSM)
        o  Deprecated Impl classes
        o  Added XML-HTTP interface
	o  New utility class HQLCriteria.  The utility class will provide
	    strong typed wrapper for the Hibernate Query Language (HQL) string.
      o  Expanded functionality of Happy.jsp page
	    (see caCORE Technical Guide for more information)
	o  Added "case-sensitive" search for attributes of "String" type.
        o  Improved the logging infrastructure by replacing the console (or standard out)
            logging with Log4j.  This allows better debugging and control of the application
            at runtime.
	o  Improved handling of the Hibernate inheritance mapping.  Now supports joined-subclasses
    *  Removed Semantic Connector 
           (replaced by Semantic Integration Workbench)
    *  Refactored Ant build script (build.xml)
        o  Added properties file to manage all path/file names
        o  Added ability to customize portions of build script
        o  Organized output directories better
        o  Added more granular targets for code/artifact generation
        o  Added option to deploy to JBoss instead of Tomcat
    *  New utility class XMLUtility.  The XMLUtility class that provides the ability to serialize and deserialize domain objects using Castor API with an SDK generated castor mapping file. 
    *  ORM generation now supports "Eager" fetching of the associated objects.
            This should improve performance for objects especially with many-to-one.
    * Writable API's now optional by setting build parameter
    * XML Schema generator - SDK will generate XML schemas for uml packages which can be used to validate serialized domain objects. 



Version 1.0.3 (July 28, 2005)

    *  Added cache generation module


Version 1.0.2  (April 12, 2005)

    *  Enabled Semantic Connector component
    *  Updated Programmer's Guide
        o  Removed references to winmysqladmin.exe (no longer shipped
           with MySql)
        o  Corrected errors referring to UML/XMI versions required by
           the SDK
        o  Added Getting Started instructions to verify that environment
           variables are set

Version 1.0.1  (February 16, 2005)

    *  Added apache-ant-1.6.2-bin.zip (missing from 1.0)
    *  Fixed bug that caused Happy.jsp not to be deployed

Version 1.0    (January 31, 2005)

Please read the caCORE SDK Programmer's Guide before downloading 
the SDK.

================================================================
                         3.0 Known Issues
================================================================
1. caCORE SDK has XML compatibility issues with Tomcat 5.0/5.5. 
In order to use Tomcat 5.0, users have to replace the included 
XML parser (under tomcat_home/common/endorsed) with the version 
that comes with Tomcat 4.1.31.

2. caCORE SDK does not support ordered collections.

3. The UML Loader is not included in the caCORE SDK Version 1.1.  
The NCICB will load properly semantically annotated XMI files 
for users (see the Developers Guide for details).

4. The SDK will generate java beans and Hibernate mapping files
correctly for primitive data types.  However if the database 
column has null (no data) value then Hibernate will throw an 
exception. To avoid this make sure the database column is not 
nullable. For further clarification please consult 
Hibernate's documentation if you experience any problems.
In the application service layer if a value is not found for a 
primitive, the java primitive default value for that primitive will
be set.

5. The automated download of Tomcat and MySQL can fail if the download 
mirror sites and backup sites change or are down. In the event of 
this happening you may need to modify the relevant properties in 
/conf/download.properties

6. When building a system, an error will be generated if Java keywords are used as
class and attribute names in the UML logical model.  Similarly, SQL keywords in the
data model will generate errors.
    
7. If you use multiple datasources from different datbase servers the toolkit
will not be able to generate multiple orm*.cfg.xml files automatically. You will
need to generate a single orm then manually split that file into however many
orms you are using.

8. The HTTP interface has reserved characters like % # are reserved characters. 
If the reserved characters are part of the query, the http parse will not work 
correctly.  Example, "test%122".  Workaround use wild card

	Example: "test*122"

9. If you want to enable security, then the hibernate jar file in the lib directory should 
be upgraded to v3.0.5. This is because CSM uses features provided by hibernate v3.0.5 for 
its internal logging purpose. However, we have seen that upgrading to v3.0.5 enable the 
pre-fetching of the childs object even when lazy initialization is enabled. This may cause 
some performance issues in case there is a huge amount of data.

10. Web Services generates queries based on the attribute values of the criteria object.
If the attribute is an association the value for the association is ignored. This could be
one-one, one-many, many-many or many-one association type. 

	Example: 
		Gene gene = new Gene(); 
		Taxon taxon = new Taxon(); 
		taxon.setId(new Long(5)); 
		gene.setTaxon(taxon); 
		Object[] resultList = (Object[])call.invoke(new Object[] { "gov.nih.nci.cabio.domain.ws.Gene", gene }); 

This method will return all the Genes from the database. Taxon value of the Gene will be ignored.

11. The HBM files generated using the caCORE SDK does not have any casade properties set.
As the result writeable operations are only performed on the the parent object and are not
propagated to the child objects. However the child objects can be created separately and 
linked to the parent objects while saving the parent object. Also the child objects can be
updated seperately. In case of delete the child object needs to be deleted separetly. 
At the same time the association with the parent object needs to removed and the parent
object needs to be updated to reflect the same.

12. Those developers who do not wish have the SDK generate Hibernate OR mapping files
should uncomment the following line in the build-custom.properties file contained 
within the base directory of the SDK. These file can be used to turn of any ant target
contained within the build file.

	 #generate-OR-mapping.main.ignore=yes

13. HTTP Interface throws an Exception when queried for a DescLogicConcept with a Property 
or Role value. 

	Example: 
		http://cbioqa101.nci.nih.gov:49080/cacore31/GetHTML?query=DescLogicConcept&DescLogicConcept[roleCollection[@name=EO_Disease_Has_Associated_EO_Anatomy][@value=heart*]]

                         4.0 Bug fixes
================================================================

1. Performance problems encountered when dealing with large datasets have been
resolved using a ListProxy to throttle large result sets.

2. The include_package and exclude_package property in the deploy.properties
file works as expected if you use a | symbol rather than a comma. For example,
if you wish to include objects from multiple packages like domain and toys 
you would use a Perl regular expression as shown below:

include_package=.*domain.*|.*toys.*

3. Previously, the Semantic Connector had some issues breaking class and attributes
names based on underscores and case changes. This has been fixed and implemented in 
the new Semantic Integration Workbench (SIW).

4. The code generator no longer requires the package name "domain" be contained 
within overall package name.
