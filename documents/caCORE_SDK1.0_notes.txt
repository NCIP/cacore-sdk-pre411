                1.0 caCORE SDK Introduction and History
================================================================

The caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools that 
can be used by an intermediate Java developer to create a 
'caCORE-like' system. Such systems are constructed using certain 
design principles:
     * UML Modeling
     * n-tier architecture with open APIs
     * controlled vocabularies
     * registered metadata

A system built along these lines is said to be 'semantically 
integrated', that is, there exists runtime metadata that describes 
every class and class attribute in the API.

================================================================
caCORE SDK Components
The caCORE SDK includes the following components:
     •	Sample UML object/data model to use with the development kit
        o	cabioExampleModel.eap
     •	XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) Version of the sample model
        o	cabioExampleModel.xmi
     •	Framework packages
        o	gov.nih.nci.system
        o	gov.nih.nci.common
        o	hibernate.net.sf.hibernate
     •	Configuration files to enable you to customize your 
        installation to meet your specific database, server,
        and other network needs
        o	deploy.properties
        o	download.properties
     •	Ant buildfile
     •	Semantic connector package (Available with caCORE 3.0 Release)
        o	gov.nih.nci.semantic
     •	EVS package
        o	gov.nih.nci.evs.domain
        o	gov.nih.nci.evs.query
     •	Code generator package
        o	gov.nih.nci.codegen.core
        o	gov.nih.nci.codegen.framework
        o	Java JET templates for generating caCORE like APIs
     •	MySQL database
     •	Demo package with examples of how to leverage the code 
        generation framework (for advanced users)

Please read the caCORE SDK Programmer's Guide before downloading 
the SDK.

================================================================
                         3.0 Known Issues
================================================================
1. caCORE SDK has XML compatibility issues with Tomcat 5.0/5.5. 
In order to use Tomcat 5.0, users have to replace the included 
XML parser (under tomcat_home/common/endorsed) with the version 
that comes with Tomcat 4.1.31.

2. When work with caCORE SDK for a large data set, users may 
encounter potential performance issues

3. caCORE SDK does not support ordered collections.

4. The UML Loader is not included in the caCORE SDK Version 1.0  
but will be available in the next release. Until then, NCICB will load
properly semantically annotated XMI files for users (see the Developers 
Guide for details)

5. The SDK will generate java beans and Hibernate mapping files
correctly for primitive data types.  However if the database 
column has null (no data) value then Hibernate will throw an 
exception. To avoid this make sure the database column is not 
nullable. For further clarification please consult 
Hibernate's documentation if you experience any problems.
In the application service layer if a value is not found for a 
primative, the java primitive default value for that primitive will
be set.


6. include_package does not support comma as a delimiter

7. The Ant task to generate junit tests will generate tests for abstract
classes. You will need to delete those test before compiling and running
the tests for concrete classes.

8. Initialization in  the Hibernate OR mapping files is set to "lazy=false" 
(eager initialization). This will initialize all the associated objects of 
the object begin queried. 

9. The automated download of Tomcat and MySQL can fail if the download 
mirror sites and backup sites change or are down. In the event of 
this happening you may need modify the url values for the 'mysql_url' and 'tomcat_url' 
properties in the /conf/download.properties.
