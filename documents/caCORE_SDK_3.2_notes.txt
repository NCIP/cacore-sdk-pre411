    caCORE SDK 1.1

    --  27 March 2006

    caCORE SDK 1.0.3

    --  28 July 2005

    caCORE SDK 1.0.2

    --  12 April 2005

    caCORE SDK 1.0.1

    --  16 February 2005

    caCORE SDK 1.0

    --  31 January 2005

    The caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools
    that can be used by an intermediate Java developer to create
    a 'caCORE-like' system. Such systems are constructed using
    certain design principles:

    --  UML Modeling

    --  n-tier architecture with open APIs

    --  controlled vocabularies

    --  registered metadata

    A system built along these lines is said to be 'semantically
    integrated', that is, there exists runtime metadata that
    describes every class and class attribute in the API.

	2.0 Features
================================================================


    +---------------------------------------+
    | caCORE SDK Components                 |
    +---------------------------------------+

    The caCORE SDK includes the following components:

    --  Sample UML object/data model to use with the development
	kit.

	--  cabio.eap

    --  XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) Version of the sample
	model.

        --  cabioExampleModel.xmi

    --  Framework packages

        --  gov.nih.nci.system
        --  gov.nih.nci.common
        --  org.hibernate

    --  Configuration files to enable you to customize your 
        installation to meet your specific database, server,
        and other network needs.

        --  deploy.properties
        --  download.properties

    --  Ant buildfile

    --  Code generator package

        --  gov.nih.nci.codegen.core
        --  gov.nih.nci.codegen.framework
        --  Java JET templates for generating caCORE like APIs

    --  MySQL database

    Please read the caCORE SDK Programmer's Guide before
    downloading the SDK.

	3.0 Bug fixes
================================================================


    --  If two classes had multiple asscociations between them,
	the Java API was returning the same instance for both
	the association. Now the Java API returns correct
	associated object. However, the HTTP interface and
	WebService Interfaces still have the problem.

    --  The Web interface on Tomcat was not working due to
	request forwarding. The defect have been resolved. 

    --  One-to-One association modeling required association
	end's name to be same as the association type. The SDK
	can now accept any name for the association end.

    --  The JUnit Test cases generated by SDK were not working.
	They are now generated correctly.

    --  The SDK always tried to start the MySQL database even
	though the deploy property indicated it should not.
	The defect has been resolved and MySql will only be
	started if specified by the user.

    --  The LazyInitializationException thrown on the client
	side from the Java Beans is now supressed.


================================================================
	4.0 Known Issues
================================================================


    --  The caCORE SDK has XML compatibility issues with Tomcat
	5.0/5.5. In order to use Tomcat 5.0, users have to
	replace the included XML parser (under
	tomcat_home/common/endorsed) with the version that
	comes with Tomcat 4.1.31.

    --  The caCORE SDK does not support ordered collections.

    --  The UML Loader is not included in the caCORE SDK
	Version 3.2. The NCICB will load semantically
	annotated XMI files for users (see the Developers Guide
	for details).

    --  The SDK will not generate java beans for primitive data
	types

    --  The automated download of Tomcat and MySQL can fail if
	the download mirror sites and backup sites change or are
	down. In the event of this happening you may need to
	modify the relevant properties in
	/conf/download.properties

    --  When building a system, an error will be generated if
	Java keywords are used as class and attribute names in
	the UML logical model.  Similarly, SQL keywords in the
	data model will generate errors.
   
    --  If you use multiple datasources from different databases
	servers, the toolkit will not be able to generate
	multiple orm*.cfg.xml files automatically. You will need
	to generate a single ORM, then manually split that file
	into however many ORMs you are using.

    --  The HTTP interface has reserved characters like % and #.
	If the reserved characters are part of the query, the
	HTTP parser will not work correctly.
	
	Example:
	"test%122".  

	A workaround is to use the wild card character '*':

	Example: 
	"test*122"

    --  Web Services generates queries based on the attribute
	values of the criteria object. If the attribute is an
	association, the value for the association is ignored.
	This includes one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many or 
	many-to-one relationships.

	Example: 
	  Gene gene = new Gene(); 
	  Taxon taxon = new Taxon(); 
	  taxon.setId(new Long(5)); 
	  gene.setTaxon(taxon); 
	  Object[] resultList = (Object[])call.invoke(new Object[] 
		{ "gov.nih.nci.cabio.domain.ws.Gene", gene }); 

	This method will return all the Genes from the database.
	The Taxon value attribute of the Gene will be ignored.

    --  The HBM files generated using the caCORE SDK does not
	have any cascade properties set. As a result, the
	writeable operations are only performed on the the
	parent object and are not propagated to the child
	objects. However the child objects can be created
	separately and linked to the parent objects while
	saving the parent object. Also the child objects can
	be updated seperately. In the case of delete, the child
	object needs to be deleted separetely. At the same time
	the association with the parent object needs to removed
	and the parent object needs to be updated to reflect
	the same.

    --  Those developers who do not wish have the SDK generate
	Hibernate OR mapping files should uncomment the
	following line in the build-custom.properties file
	contained within the base directory of the SDK.
	Likewise, other properties can be toggled in order to
	control the execution of the various ANT targets
	contained within the build file.

	#generate-OR-mapping.main.ignore=yes

    --  When two objects have multiple associations between
	them, the SDK generated system returns only one of the
	associated object via the HTTP and Web Service
	interfaces. The generated Java API does return the
	correct instance.
